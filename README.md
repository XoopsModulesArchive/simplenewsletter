**SimpleNewsletter** is a module to manage newsletters on your XOOPS site. Unlike other newsletters modules, it is capable of sending large numbers of the same newsletter to your users through one of its blocks or via a CRON (a kind a planified task). 

**XOOPS Module Archive:** Modules in this archive are older modules for XOOPS CMS, and therefore some of them might not work with the latest XOOPS and PHP versions. 

However, please fork them and if you have any improvements and fixes, please share them back with us.
