    <h4 class="odd">Description</h4>

    <p class="even">SimpleNewsletter allows you to easily create and send newsletters (in text or in html) to the registered users of your site (whatever their number is) and it will enable them to read the past issues from your site.<br /> <br />


    Unlike other newsletters modules, it is capable of sending large numbers of the same newsletter to your users through one of its blocks or via a CRON (a kind a planified task).<br /> <br />

    In its administrative part, the module allows you to create as many newsletters as you want, to stop and to resume emailing, to edit and remove newsletters, to manage subscriptions (adding or removing members, adding all Members of the site), to manage the content of a welcome and goodbye email when users unsubscribe. You can also manage the welcome of the index page.<br /> <br />

    On the user side, the module can show a list of the previous newsletters and to view the content of each one.<br /> <br />

    The module is integrated to the Xoops search, it has an RSS feed and has 4 blocks:<br /> <br />
    - The list of the last subscribers<br />
    - The last newsletters<br />
    - A block allowing each user to know his state (subscribed or not)<br />
    - A dedicated bloc to send newsletters if you don't have a CRON.<br /><br />
